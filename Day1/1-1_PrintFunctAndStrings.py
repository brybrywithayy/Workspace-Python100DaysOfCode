# Using the print() function

print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")                
# why single quotes inside the string?
# Because Python does not care if you use single or double quotes
# However, if we nest double quotes inside of another double quote without escape chars,
# it will read the string incorrectly


# Using \n to print on new line
print("Hello, world!\nHello world!")    # the escape char \n creates a new line

# Concatenating strings
print("Hello," + "Name")  # no space in between words
print("Hello, " + "Name") # with a space
